### Yet Another PL/0 Compiler

I made this for two reasons:
* One of my strongest interests in all of computer science is compiler design.
* It seems my university will likely not offer the Compiler Design course in my upcoming senior year.

So, this is just an educational thing for me, but it turned out pretty well, so I'm putting it here.

The three executables generated by `make` show the outputs of different stages of the compiler.

1. The lexer phase prints out all of the tokens it recognizes.
2. The parser phase prints out a Lisp-like abstract syntax tree for the code that it recognizes.
3. The compiler phase prints out NASM-like assembly code for a hypothetical stack machine architecture.

(Input is always from `stdin` for these examples)

Also, the compiler doesn't do any optimizations yet.
(I wrote the compilation stage in, like, 10 minutes.)

Fun fact: to practice some embedded software development methodology,
I made the parser take advantage of region-based memory allocation *very* extensively,
so the whole tree and all of its contents can be freed all at once just by freeing the root.

#### To-do list:
* Add better error handling.
* Improve the lexer stage.
* Create an intermediate code to compile to/from.
* Add an optimization stage.
